# Loan-Repayment-Assessment-in-Banking
Task is to build and train a model that identifies a customer will repay or default from the loan dataset

# Data Preprocessing:
Handling missing values: Missing values were filled using appropriate techniques such as filling with mode or mean.
Feature Encoding: Categorical variables were encoded into numerical format for model training.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analysis of loan status distribution.
Visualization of loan status distribution and percentage of paid vs. defaulted loans.

# Feature Engineering:

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space.

# Undersampling:

Used undersampling technique to balance the dataset by reducing the majority class (paid loans) to match the size of the minority class (defaulted loans).

# Model Building:

Logistic Regression Model: Trained and evaluated a logistic regression model for predicting loan repayment.
Random Forest Model: Trained and evaluated a random forest classifier for predicting loan repayment.
Parameter Tuning: Performed hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation to optimize model performance.

# Model Evaluation:

Calculated accuracy and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
Utilized k-fold cross-validation for more robust evaluation of model performance.
